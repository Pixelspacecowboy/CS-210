# CS-210
Classwork/Projects
Course Overview
Welcome to Programming Languages, CS 210! This course focuses on learning the C++ programming language. Throughout the semester, you will gain a deep understanding of C++ syntax, semantics, and best practices, as well as develop problem-solving and programming skills.

Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Understand the basic syntax and structure of C++.
Implement programs using various control structures (loops, conditionals).
Utilize functions and understand their scope and lifetime.
Work with arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.
Implement object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Understand and apply principles of good software design and coding practices.
Project Summary and Achievements
In my CS 210 course, I developed an Inventory Management System using C++. This project aimed to create an efficient solution for managing inventory in a small business, addressing issues such as tracking stock levels, managing product information, and generating sales reports. I implemented a robust database management system and utilized object-oriented programming principles to ensure modular and reusable code, which I am particularly proud of.

Challenges and Improvements
One of the most challenging aspects was integrating file I/O operations to read and write inventory data, as handling various edge cases like file not found or read/write errors required careful consideration. I overcame these challenges by consulting online resources, such as C++ reference documentation and Stack Overflow, and seeking guidance from my instructor. Looking forward, optimizing the sorting algorithm for displaying inventory items to use quicksort instead of bubble sort could significantly enhance the program's efficiency, reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

Skills and Maintainability
This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of C++ syntax and semantics, improved my problem-solving strategies, and provided experience with file handling and database management. To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I adhered to best practices, including using descriptive variable names, writing comments for complex logic, and structuring the code in a modular way. These skills and practices are transferable to other projects and coursework, making my code easier to manage and extend in the future.
